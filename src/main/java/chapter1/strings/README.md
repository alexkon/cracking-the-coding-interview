# Arrays and Strings

## Notes
1. You should know how works HashTable structure
2. Usually you should use HashTable, ArrayList, StringBuffer
3. Use StringBuffer carefully (concatenation works O(n^2) time complexity)
4. When edit a String in place do it from the end
 
## Problems

1. Find duplicates:
    - sort collection
    - use bit vector or boolean array if appropriate
    - use set of elements
    
2. Check for permutation:
    - sort and equals
    - count each symbol in array or map
