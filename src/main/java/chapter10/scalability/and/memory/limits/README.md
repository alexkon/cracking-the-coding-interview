# Scalability and Memory Limits

## Step-By-Step approach:

### 1) Make Believe 
(imagine you don't have any memory limitations and use only one machine)

### 2) Get Real
(two questions: how much data you can store on one machine and how you
would spread data between machines)

### 3) Solve Problems

## Dividing Up Lots of Data:

### 1) By order of Appearance

### 2) By hash value

### 3) By actual value (ex: by city or country) 

### 4) Arbitrarily (use lookup table)
