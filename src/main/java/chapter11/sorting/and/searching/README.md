# Sorting and Searching

## Common Sorting Algorithms

### 1) Bubble Sort | Runtime: O(n^2) average and worst case. Memory: O(1)

### 2) Selection Sort | Runtime: O(n^2) average and worst case. Memory: O(1)

### 3) Merge Sort | Runtime: O(n * log(n)) average and worst case. Memory: Depends (O(n) with arrays and O(log(n)) for linked lists)

### 4) Quick Sort | Runtime: O(n * log(n)) average and O(n^2) worst case. Memory: O(log(n))

### 5) Radix Sort (bucket sort) | Runtime: O(kn). Memory: O(n)
