# Trees and Graphs

### Key difference between tree and graph:
Working with graphs use should mark each node as visited (node.visited = true) to avoid infinite loop.

### For the graphs use should know the implementatioin of two basics algorithms:
- DFS (Deep-First-Search)
- BFS (Breadth-First-Search)
