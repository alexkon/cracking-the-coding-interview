# Testing

## What the interviewer is looking for?
1) Big picture understanding
2) Knowing how the pieces fit together
3) Organization (can you approach in structured manner)
4) Practicality (can you create reasonable testing plan)


## Four types of testing
1) Testing a real world objects
2) Testing a piece of software
3) Testing a function
4) Troubleshooting question


### Testing a real world objects
1) Who will use it? And why?
2) What are the use cases?
3) What are the bounds of use?
4) What are the stress conditions?
5) How would you perform the testing?

### Testing a piece of software
1) Are we doing Black Box testing or White Box testing?
2) Who will use it? And why?
3) What are the use cases?
4) What are the bounds of use?
5) What are the stress conditions?
6) What are the test cases? How would you perform the testing?

### Testing a function
1) Define the test cases:
    - the normal cases
    - the extremes
    - Nulls and "illegal" inputs
    - strange input
2) Define the expected results
3) Write test code

### Troubleshooting question
1) Understand the scenario
2) Break down the problem
3) Create specific, manageable tests
