# Recursion and Dynamic Programming

## There are three man approaches to recursive problems:

### 1) Bottom-Up Recursion

### 2) Top-Down Recursion

### 3) Base case and build

Note: Recursion algorithms can be very space inefficient - O(n) recursive 
call use O(n) memory.

## Dynamic Programming

### Usually you should cache the intermediate result for the future calls
